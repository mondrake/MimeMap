# MimeMap
#
# This file provides the script to build the default MIME-type to file extension
# map. It is used as input to the 'fileeye-mimemap' utility.
#
# The script loads the full map, then picks only the top 100 MIME-types as
# retrieved from
# https://commoncrawl.github.io/cc-crawl-statistics/plots/mimetypes
#
# The entries are executed sequentially; each entry indicates a MapUpdater
# method to be invoked and the arguments to be passed in.
